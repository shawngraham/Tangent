Tangent features a small selection of helper replacements that make inserting unicode characters via ascii characters easier.

## Arrows
Tangent will automatically detect ascii arrows (e.g,. <- or -->) and offer to replace them with unicode arrow characters (e.g. ← or ➞).

## Dashes
Tangent will offer to turn -- or --- into n or m dashes.

To avoid collision with [[Markdown Syntax]], this only happens automatically when the dashes are _not_ at the start of a line. You can press `Ctrl+Space` to invoke autocomplete manually.
