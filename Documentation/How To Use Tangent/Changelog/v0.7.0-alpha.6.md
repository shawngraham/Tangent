- Fixed an issue where using inline formatting shortcuts with cross-line selections didn't correctly apply formatting to each individual line.
- Fixed an issue where toggling inline formatting with a selection that included or intersected other inline formatting blindly added additional formatting characters, breaking formatting. All intersecting formatting is now removed in this case.
