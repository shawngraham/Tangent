+ Massively expanded [[Embedding]] & link previews! Raw links on their own line are automatically treated as "embed" links. Markdown embed links (i.e. image links) will also display link previews & embeds. Audio, video, and YouTube links are displayed in the note natively.
- Fixed a regression where `inline code` would consume the entire line.
- Fixed a regression where [[Code]] blocks would always show their closing backticks.
