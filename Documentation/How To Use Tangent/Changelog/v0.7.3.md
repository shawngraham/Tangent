+ Added some simple start & end lines for front matter.
- Fixed an issue where files with completely empty front matter failed to be indexed and caused editing issues.
- Fixed an issue where files and folders that started with a "." (and are thus hidden by default) were still indexed.
- Fixed an issue where clicking on "Manage Rules" in the new note drop down didn't correctly open the [[Creation Rules]] section of system settings.
