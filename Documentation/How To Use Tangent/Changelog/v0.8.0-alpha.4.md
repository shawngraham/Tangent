+ Added index caching. Tangent will cache workspace indexes and restore them on first load. This should speed up startup times for large workspaces.
+ Sped up index link resolution, reducing the time taken linking notes by ~50%.
+ Added the ability to click on nodes & threads within old Session Maps to add those nodes and threads to the current Session.
- Fixed an issue where the text cursor in code blocks in light mode was essentially invisible.
