- Fixed an issue where using inline formatting shortcuts with cross-line selections didn't correctly apply formatting to each individual line
- Fixed an issue where toggling inline formatting with a selection that included or intersected other inline formatting blindly added additional formatting characters, breaking formatting. All intersecting formatting is now removed in this case.
- Fixed a bug where archiving maps could cause map rendering issues.
- Fixed an issue where hitting escape while editing a filename didn't return the note's name to its original state.
- Fixed an issue where you could rename a note to empty string.
