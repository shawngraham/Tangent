+ Added a setting to disable the automatic embedding of raw links on their own line. Raw links can still be embedded by prepending them with `!`.
+ Improved preview display, and switched to using the "googlebot" user agent, improving scraped results.
+ Improved how link preview errors are handled and displayed to the user.
- Fixed an issue where markdown links had strange vertical alignment.
