The Dictionary list is found in the [[System Menu]].

Tangent uses Chromium's integration with your OS dictionary to provide spell checking. As part of that built-in functionality, you can add words Tangent thinks are misspelled to the custom dictionary.

Sometimes words are added to the dictionary by mistake. You can review the words you have added to the dictionary and remove them from this settings panel.
